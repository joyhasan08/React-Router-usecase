            <p className="">We all know that data is essential. The problem is that many times we do not have (enough of) it. As we develop data applications or pipelines, we need to test them with data that resembles what might be seen in production.</p>
            <p>Faker is a Python library that helps you generate fake data. From the documentation, we can see that it can be easily installed the following command: pip install Faker</p>
